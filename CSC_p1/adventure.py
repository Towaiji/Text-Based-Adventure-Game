        #  the choice the player made was just a movement, so only updating player's position is enough to change the
        #  location to the next appropriate location
        #  Possibilities:
        #  A helper function such as do_action(w, p, location, choice)
        #  OR A method in World class w.do_action(p, location, choice)
        #  OR Check what type of action it is, then modify only player or location accordingly
        #  OR Method in Player class for move or updating inventory
        #  OR Method in Location class for updating location item info, or other location data etc....
